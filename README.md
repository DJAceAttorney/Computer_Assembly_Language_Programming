# x86 Encryption Project
Designed an assembly program that took in a user's password and encrypted it using two different techniques the user chose. The user can "split encrypt" which allows the user to split their password at a certain character and move everything to the right of that character to the beginning of the string. The user could alos choose "jump encrypt" in which the user chooses the number of jumps they want and the password will rearrange itself so that it's spelled out using the jumped characters. For example the string "Hello" with a jump of two would be "Hloel"
